## Analyzing and predicting supermarket sales using machine learning and several libraries 

In this project, together with Nick Smith, we used Random Forest Classifier to predict the last item which customers bought while they were shopping. Also we analyzed simple market behaviours such as finding most and least frequent items and showed it in different graphs.
